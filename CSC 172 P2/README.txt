Project 2



Objective: The obejctive of this is to understand tree structures. 


OUTPUT: My file I/O is not entirel working but I hope it does. I asked Gabe Issa and Ethan
Lipkind for help on that part because I really did not underatnd it. 

They also then helped me to revise the method by which I group comparing Lines 
using a separate Line aggregator class. I've commented out sections in which they helped me. 

I also referenced code from GitHub from https://github.com/malloc47/. All code was typed out on my own.
I also googled a lot about the Trapezoidal Map and Triangulation.
